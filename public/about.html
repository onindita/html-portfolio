<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a full-stack developer with expertise in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, React, Angular, Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, Kubernetes, Docker, RDBMS, SQL, NoSQL databases, and various modern tech stacks. I’m passionate about learning and enjoy exploring new languages, technologies, and skills.</p>

<p>Traveling is a big part of my life, especially to places with stunning natural beauty and mountains. I’ve explored beautiful spots like Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, and California, as well as traveled to Thailand and Nepal.</p>

<p>I also have a cat named Buddy, who is over 12 years old. He’s my precious companion—well-behaved, adorable, and incredibly loving.</p>
